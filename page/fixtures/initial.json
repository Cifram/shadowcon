There shall be live-action role-play opportunities and table-top RPGs throughout the weekend. The commonality between them is that all games are to be dark, intense, and character driven. There will likely be a primary LARP that takes up much of Saturday, and lesser activities well into the mornings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any of you with the courage to face this darkness, please step forward.</p>"

If you want to get in, you can ring the bell at the front door of the office, you can knock on the window next to the back door and hope someone hears you, or you can call someone you know who will be there.</li>\r\n\t<li>If there is a problem with anything about the site, notify a ShadowCon coordinator (Christina, Morgan, Brittany, or Erin) immediately. Some examples of this include: if there is a spill, toilet paper runs out, toilet overflow, heater or AC needed or kitchen malfunction.</li>\r\n\t<li>You are responsible for your own mess. Clean up after yourself and leave any space that you were in, in the same condition or better.</li>\r\n\t<li>GM&rsquo;s: you are in charge of making sure that the room you used for your game is clean. Make sure to check for any cups, food, stuff on the floor, etc. If you used any computers or other electronics, be sure to turn them off again before you leave the room.</li>\r\n\t<li>If you are leaving the building after dark, use the buddy system and let others know that you are leaving.</li>\r\n\t<li>No sex on site.</li>\r\n</ul>"

The kitchen is a shared space and must be cleaned up after every use.</li>\r\n\t<li>For those caffeine fiends, there is a Keurig brewer (provide your own Keurig K-cups), and there is a large coffee brewer that can fill one of those large coffee pots (makes 8-10 cups of coffee) that costs $10/pot. There is also instant hot water for those tea lovers out there.</li>\r\n\t<li>Central Heat and AC.</li>\r\n\t<li>Free WiFi!</li>\r\n\t<li>There should be plenty of parking onsite.
